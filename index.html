        There is so much more to making a website than I thought but also
        more intuitive and logical than I had assumed. I have very little 
        vocabulary in this realm and my conception was very theoretical, it
        is great to be learning dev language! It is great to be learing 
        but in a very practical way. It was nice to hear some words I knew from intro
        backend (I now understand this term...) coding courses. But knowing basic 
        python does not seem like it will help me much... but I was also 
        mediocre at it anyways so this will be a nice fresh start! I am 
        really excited to learn more and I think the design aspect will 
        add a lot of new layers to explore!

        brief description of my mrp 
    </h1>
    <p style="text-align: center">
        I am creating an interactive narrative clickthrough "game"/modules 
        geared towards parents of infants with Craniosynostosis.
        Craniosynostosis is a skull condition in which the skull shape becomes 
        deformed due to early fusing of the skull sutures. This condition can 
        only be treated with surgical intervention, specifically two different approaches.
        My resource lets parents navigate both of the two surgical options while learning 
        about craniosynostosis.The resource will be an empathetic approach to educating and 
        informing parents to aid their decisions regarding care for their infant.

        what i want to learn 
    </h1>
    <p>
        I am looking to learn the basics of website building, whether it would be best 
        to build a website to host the game or to build the modules directly into the 
        website. AKA how to best create an online interactive module resourse.
        I am also interested in how to embed videos and other forms of media (3d models etc.)
        into the modules. I would love to learn more about how code works?... and what it 
        means to make or add code you have written to a website builder? I would love a 
        brief lesson on how to include alt text! But MRP aside I would also be interested in 
        scrolly telly creation!
