        <p>
            I am creating an interactive narrative clickthrough "game" comprised of modules 
            geared towards parents of infants with Craniosynostosis.
            Craniosynostosis is a skull condition in which the skull shape becomes 
            deformed due to early fusing of the skull sutures. This condition can 
            only be treated with surgical intervention, specifically two different approaches.
            My resource lets parents navigate both of the two surgical options while learning 
            about craniosynostosis.The resource will be an empathetic approach to educating and 
            informing parents to aid their decisions regarding care for their infant.
