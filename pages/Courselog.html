<div class="content">
  <p>There is so much more to making a website than I thought but also it is
    more intuitive and logical than I had assumed. I have very little 
    vocabulary in this realm and my knowledge is very theoretical, so it
    is great to be learning dev language in a very practical way. It was nice to hear some words I knew from
    backend (I now understand this term...) coding courses. But knowing basic 
    python does not seem like it will help me much... but I was also 
    mediocre at it anyways so this will be a nice fresh start! I am 
    really excited to learn more and I think the design aspect will 
    add a lot of new layers to explore!</p></div>
