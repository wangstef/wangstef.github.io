  <p>There is so much more to making a website than I thought but also it is
    more intuitive and logical than I had assumed. I have very little 
    vocabulary in this realm and my knowledge is very theoretical, so it
    is great to be learning dev language in a very practical way. It was nice to hear some words I knew from
    backend (I now understand this term...) coding courses. But knowing basic 
    python does not seem like it will help me much... but I was also 
    mediocre at it anyways so this will be a nice fresh start! I am 
    really excited to learn more and I think the design aspect will 
    add a lot of new layers to explore!</p></div>

  <p> Accessibility in design!! 
    
    Perceivable
     How do we make our designs clear and pleasant viewing experience

    Operable
      How do we make sure our designss work and let users have control 
    
    Understandable
      How do we make our designs logical and useable
    
    Robust 
      How do we make our designs work in different formats

    
      Figma, developer mode can be very useful in segmenting and testing each design element
      one at a time.

  I learnt a lot from the presentations of everyone's storyboards, I think there 
  is a lot to gain from each presentation and the thoughtful ways in which they 
  represented their storyboards. 
  Things I would like to implement in my future storyboards:
      1. Legend that explains elements of the storyboards
      2. Improve legibility: contrast on colours, white outline on arrows, bright 
      arrows for movement changes 
      3. Improve conprehension: enumeration on panel, script separate from movement
      cues, have hints of the context outside of the panel frames, use transparencies and 
      dotted lines
