  <p>There is so much more to making a website than I thought but also it is
    more intuitive and logical than I had assumed. I have very little 
    vocabulary in this realm and my knowledge is very theoretical, so it
    is great to be learning dev language in a very practical way. It was nice to hear some words I knew from
    backend (I now understand this term...) coding courses. But knowing basic 
    python does not seem like it will help me much... but I was also 
    mediocre at it anyways so this will be a nice fresh start! I am 
    really excited to learn more and I think the design aspect will 
    add a lot of new layers to explore!</p></div>

  <p> Accessibility in design!! 
    
    Perceivable
     How do we make our designs clear and pleasant viewing experience

    Operable
      How do we make sure our designss work and let users have control 
    
    Understandable
      How do we make our designs logical and useable
    
    Robust 
      How do we make our designs work in different formats

    
      Figma, developer mode can be very useful in segmenting and testing each design element
      one at a time.

  I learnt a lot from the presentations of everyone's storyboards, I think there 
  is a lot to gain from each presentation and the thoughtful ways in which they 
  represented their storyboards. 
  Things I would like to implement in my future storyboards:
      1. Legend that explains elements of the storyboards
      2. Improve legibility: contrast on colours, white outline on arrows, bright 
      arrows for movement changes 
      3. Improve conprehension: enumeration on panel, script separate from movement
      cues, have hints of the context outside of the panel frames, use transparencies and 
      dotted lines

Today we learned about Scrollytelling, what they are good for (linear storytelling) and what they 
are not as good for (nonlinear branching). 
"Scrolling is a continuation and clicking is a decision" - Joshua Porter
We also learned the 5 rules:
1. users prefer scrolling to clicking: effortless, while efficient we can scan faster than we scroll, people scan faster
    1. Donâ€™t hide things that you want people to see (they go fast and may miss it)
    2. Indicate scrolling clearly and some progress
2. Allow rapid, incremental, reversible scrolling
    1. Swiping elements
    2. The content is fixed on the scroll and then the panel moves 
3. Provide instantaneous, consistent feedback:
    1. providing input with mouse must have an instant response 
    2. Visual feedback is essential to adjust their input
    3. Should be able to scroll opposite and the opposite happens
4. Avoid unwanted disruptions
    1. screen and viewport is many times bigger than foveal view, how to make sure users get the time to get ready before interaction begins 
    2. common - if you want an autoplay the video will take the whole screen, there is a fade to black, allow the user to scrub forward and back if needed,
5. Support standard keyboard controls
